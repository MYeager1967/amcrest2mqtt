# amcrest2mqtt

Original work done by D Chesterton. I have done a little work so far and updated the libraries so that they are current.
I have also corrected and finished a few things I saw in the issues for his repository. I had been working on something
very similar to this for quite some time, so picking this up was a fairly straightforward thing and it benefitted me
as well as you if you were using his code. Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions that could
make this even more useful.

A simple app to expose all events generated by an Amcrest device to MQTT using the
[`python-amcrest`](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-amcrest) library.

It supports the following environment variables:

-   `AMCREST_HOST` (required)
-   `AMCREST_PORT` (optional, default = 80)
-   `AMCREST_USERNAME` (optional, default = admin)
-   `AMCREST_PASSWORD` (required)
-   `MQTT_USERNAME` (required)
-   `MQTT_PASSWORD` (optional, default = empty password)
-   `MQTT_HOST` (optional, default = 'localhost')
-   `MQTT_QOS` (optional, default = 0)
-   `MQTT_PORT` (optional, default = 1883)
-   `MQTT_TLS_ENABLED` (required if using TLS) - set to `true` to enable
-   `MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT` (required if using TLS) - path to the ca certs
-   `MQTT_TLS_CERT` (required if using TLS) - path to the private cert
-   `MQTT_TLS_KEY` (required if using TLS) - path to the private key
-   `HOME_ASSISTANT` (optional, default = false)
-   `HOME_ASSISTANT_PREFIX` (optional, default = 'homeassistant')
-   `STORAGE_POLL_INTERVAL` (optional, default = 3600) - how often to fetch storage data (in seconds) (set to 0 to disable functionality)
-   `DEVICE_NAME` (optional) - override the default device name used in the Amcrest app

It exposes events to the following topics:

-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/event` - all events
-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/doorbell` - doorbell status (if AD110 or AD410)
-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/human` - human detection (if AD410)
-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/motion` - motion events (if supported)
-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/config` - device configuration information
-   `amcrest2mqtt/[SERIAL_NUMBER]/ivs/[RuleName]` - status of IVS rules as defined on camera (if used)

## Device Support

The app supports events for any Amcrest device supported by [`python-amcrest`](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-amcrest).

## Home Assistant

The app has built-in support for Home Assistant discovery. Set the `HOME_ASSISTANT` environment variable to `true` to enable support.
If you are using a different MQTT prefix to the default, you will need to set the `HOME_ASSISTANT_PREFIX` environment variable.

## Running the app

The easiest way to run the app is via Docker Compose, e.g.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
    amcrest2mqtt:
        container_name: amcrest2mqtt
        image: myeager1967/amcrest2mqtt:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            AMCREST_HOST: 192.168.0.1
            AMCREST_PASSWORD: password
            MQTT_HOST: 192.168.0.2
            MQTT_USERNAME: admin
            MQTT_PASSWORD: password
            HOME_ASSISTANT: "true"
```

## Out of Scope

### Multiple Devices

The app will not support multiple devices. You can run multiple instances of the app if you need to expose events for multiple devices.

### Non-Docker Environments

Docker is the only supported way of deploying the application. The app should run directly via Python but this is not supported.

### Home Assistant Addons

There are a couple of Home Assistant Addons that use my code to be able to port this software into Supervised versions of Home Assistant. I do not specifically support the add-ons themselves, only the base software in the original docker format. Please contact the authors of those add-ons for support if using that method.
